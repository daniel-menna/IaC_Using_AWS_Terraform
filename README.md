# Testing ML models accuracy using Infraestructure automation with Terraform

## Objective
In this project, I implemented an infrastructure at AWS using Terraform for automation to check the accuracy of three differente machine learning models with LLC.

The project structure includes the setup of an EMR cluster on AWS, configured to execute distributed Machine Learning tasks. The training stack is designed to be scalable and resilient, leveraging AWS services for resource management and monitoring. Automated deployment and continuous integration are facilitated by infrastructure-as-code scripts and templates, ensuring replicability and consistency of the environment. 

The result is a robust solution for training Machine Learning models that can handle petabyte-scale data challenges, ideal for organizations seeking deep insights from large datasets.

### Main Stacks
